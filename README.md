# Enhancing User Experience with a Personalized Product Recommendation Engine using PySpark
# Abstract:
This project aims to develop a scalable personalized product recommendation system using PySpark, a distributed computing framework. The project focuses on comparing the execution time and speed of PySpark with a Python implementation to assess the advantages of distributed computing in recommendation systems. Personalized product recommendations are vital for improving user experience and boosting sales in the competitive e-commerce landscape. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, random forest, and decision tree algorithms to predict the best product IDs based on user purchase histories and ratings. Data pre-processing is performed to clean and transform the dataset. Evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and precision-recall are used to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the models. By implementing the system in both PySpark and Python, this project aims to provide insights into the efficiency and scalability of distributed computing for personalized product recommendations.
# Objective: 
The main objective of this project is to build a personalized product recommendation system using PySpark and compare its execution time and speed with a Python implementation. The specific objectives include:

• Implementing collaborative filtering, random forest, and decision tree algorithms to predict the best product IDs for individual users based on their purchase histories and associated ratings.

• Preprocessing the dataset to clean and transform the data, ensuring it is in a suitable format for analysis. 

• Evaluating the performance of the recommendation system by comparing the predicted ratings with the actual ratings provided by users. Metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and precision-recall will be used to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the models.

• Building the recommendation system using both PySpark and Python to compare their execution time and speed. This will provide insights into the efficiency and scalability of distributed computing with PySpark.

• Analyzing the results to identify the most effective approach for personalized product recommendations and determine the benefits of using PySpark for large-scale data processing. 

By achieving these objectives, this project aims to develop an efficient and accurate personalized product recommendation system while also comparing the performance of PySpark and Python implementations to understand the advantages of distributed computing
