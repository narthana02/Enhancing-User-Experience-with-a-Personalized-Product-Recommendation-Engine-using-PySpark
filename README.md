# Enhancing User Experience with a Personalized Product Recommendation Engine using PySpark
# Abstract:
This project aims to develop a scalable personalized product recommendation system using PySpark, a distributed computing framework. The project focuses on comparing the execution time and speed of PySpark with a Python implementation to assess the advantages of distributed computing in recommendation systems. Personalized product recommendations are vital for improving user experience and boosting sales in the competitive e-commerce landscape. The system utilizes collaborative filtering, random forest, and decision tree algorithms to predict the best product IDs based on user purchase histories and ratings. Data pre-processing is performed to clean and transform the dataset. Evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and precision-recall are used to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the models. By implementing the system in both PySpark and Python, this project aims to provide insights into the efficiency and scalability of distributed computing for personalized product recommendations.
